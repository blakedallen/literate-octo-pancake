# Longitudinal Overview Project (LOP)
Repository for the Longitudinal Overview Project (LOP), a natural language processing (NLP) multi-language translation analysis. 

## Overview

English-to-N text transformers for many different domains exist, but this project aims to analyze the differences in various language-to-text models and see where analyses and improvements can be made. This survey exists as not an exhaustive list of specific transformers and existing NLP technologies but a careful analysis of the best SOA and known transformers on the market. Particular attention will be paid to English/French delineation, but further research is to be conducted. 

## Targets
- initialize corpus of English-to-French dictionary
- work with current SOA models and instantiate them to develop baselines
- expert research and analysis of faults of current systems
- user analysis and pipeline development

## Dataset

- Aligned Hansards of the 36th Parliament of Canada
